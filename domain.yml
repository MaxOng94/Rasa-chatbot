  utter_faq/ask_ai:
  - text: The powerful combination of AI and RPA can allow an organisation to process
      data from virtually any source across virtually any system. This includes information
      that is housed within multiple types of files and documents, including emails,
      PDF files, scans and photos. By augmenting robots with cognitive abilities,
      a company can achieve end-to-end process automation. In other words, they can
      automate tasks that previously required human input. This means that workers
      are able to focus their time on projects that benefit from their unique skillset
      and expertise.
